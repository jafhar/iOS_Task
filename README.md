x# iOS_Task iOS App, which displays list of Dogs Breed and Sub Breeds list and also detail (jut Image as of now)

You will have to create an iOS app which can search, cache and display results from the below API. 

https://dog.ceo/dog-api/ 


The flow of the application should be like this:  
    The launch screen should have a list of breeds for the user to select from.
    You can be innovative in making the list searchable for better user experience.  
    Once the user selects a breed, the next view should display him an image of that breed and a list of sub 
    breeds for that breed which can again be selected to see details of the sub-breed.
    Cache the image so that if the same breed is selected again the image can be shown from the cache itself. 
    The user should be able to go back to the listing page to change his selection. 


///**/// Note:  NSCache is used for storing images, we can use Core Data for storing images. Will try in next version soon :) ///**//
